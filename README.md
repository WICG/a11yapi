Browser-based applications need an API to use the accessibility features of modern operating systems, and to manage input across a wide array of devices (touch, mouse, keyboard, pen, voice, etc.). Accessibility in browsers is enabled today by putting markup in web content, but this approach can be difficult for app developers to apply in practice.

The intent of this work is to take different APIs that are under development for this purpose, specifically Microsoft [WAPA](https://github.com/cyns/wapa) proposal, the Mozilla Web Accessibility API project, and the [IndieUI Events draft](http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events/), and native platform APIs and work toward a single specification, guidance for mapping to platform APIs, and suggestions to platform implementers on how to fill holes in those APIs.
